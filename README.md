# chatbot
This is a chatbot made with open AI and trained on custom data. It scans a pumble channel for any questions asked and answers the questions. If it find a question it cannot answer it send an SMS to a trainer requesting for an answer and ingests that question and response as part of its data. After some time it will be able to work on its own independently.
